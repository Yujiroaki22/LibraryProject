                The Notebook was Nicholas Sparks first published novel
                 and written over a time period of six months in 1994.
                 Literary agent Theresa Park discovered Sparks by picking
                  the book out of her agency's slush pile and reading it. 
                  Park offered to represent him. In October 1995, Park secured 
                  a $1 million advance for the book from the Time Warner Book Group,
                and the novel was published in October 1996. It was on The New York 
                   Times Best Seller list in its first week of release. The Notebook was 
                   a hardcover best seller for more than a year.

            <h3>Book Excerpt</h3>
            <p>The novel opens with Noah Calhoun, an old man, reading to a woman in 
                a nursing home. He tells her the following story:
                Noah, 24, returns from World War II to his town of New Bern, North Carolina.
                He finishes restoring an antebellum-style house, after his father's death. 
                Meanwhile, Allie, 24, sees the house in the newspaper and decides to pay him
                a visit.
                <div class="content">
                <p>They are meeting, again, after a 7-year separation, which followed their
                     brief but passionate summer romance when her family was visiting the town.
                    They were separated by class, as she was the daughter of a wealthy family,
                     and he worked as a laborer in a lumberyard. Seeing each other brings on a
                      flood of memories and strong emotions in both of them. They have dinner 
                      together and talk about their lives and the past. Allie learns that Noah had
                       written letters to her for one year after their breakup. She realizes that her
                        mother hid the letters so that Allie could never receive them and would conclude
                         that Noah had forgotten about her. They talk about what could have happened between
                          them without her mother's interference. At the end of the night, Noah invites Allie
                           to come back the next day and promises her a surprise. She decides to see him again.
                            During this time, her fiancé, Lon, tries to reach her at the hotel. When Allie does 
                            not respond to his calls, he begins to worry.
                    The next day, Noah takes Allie on a canoe ride in a small lake where swans and geese swim.
                     She is enchanted. On their way back, they are caught in a storm and end up soaked. When they
                      return to his house, they talk again about how important they were to each other, and how their
                       feelings have not changed. Noah and Allie share a kiss and make love.
                    Allie's mother shows up the next morning and gives Allie the letters from Noah.
                     When her mother leaves, Allie is torn and has a decision to make. She knows she loves Noah, 
                     but she does not want to hurt Lon. Noah begs her to stay with him, but she decides to leave. 
                     She cries all the way back to the hotel and starts reading the letters her mother returned to her.
                      At the hotel, her fiancé Lon is waiting in the lobby</p></div>
