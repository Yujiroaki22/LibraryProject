            <p >Red Rising is a 2014 dystopian science fiction novel by American author Pierce Brown,
               and the first book and eponym of a series. The novel, set in the future on Mars, follows lowborn miner Darrow as he infiltrates the ranks of the elite Golds. Red Rising has received generally positive reviews.</p</p>

            <h3>Book Excerpt</h3>
            <p>Red Rising is the story of Darrow, a sixteen-year-old Red boy on Mars. I know what you’re thinking: A male narrator who’s 16? If he’s not Augustus Waters-level deep, I’m not in! But no fear. Darrow is a great narrator, an awesome protagonist, and very feminist-minded on account of his wife, Eo. I know what you’re thinking again. He’s already married?! Where is the romance?! No fear my friends, NO FEAR. If you have read any of my articles you know that I consider myself to be someone overly invested in romance. I basically eschew all novels and movies that don’t have romance (and yet, I love them deeply when forced to watch them. Shawshank Redemption, or Foyle’s War, anyone?) so this book definitely had enough, but I will say it’s not primarily a romance. 
              WHICH I LOVED. The type of book it was can best be described by the following one-liners:
                </p>
                <div class="content">
                <p>Darrow is a miner living in sad conditions, always scrambling for food for his family, where the struggle is actually real for him. But he doesn’t mind much since Reds are told they are the pioneers on Mars, and that their mining colony is paving the way for more people to begin to live on Mars. In his mind, a noble task. And he loves his wife a lot, so he’s ignorantly content. That is until he finds out that this is a huge lie and they are basically slaves while all the other colors live a fancy life in other cities on Mars. Messed up, yo. MESSED UP. From there, Darrow is chosen to join a rebel group as their mole to become a Gold and infiltrate society, rise up and then demolish the unjust hierarchy. It’s basically if Katniss pretended to be from the Capital so that she could befriend Pres. Snow and then lead a rebellion, which sort of happened anyhow. I thought Red Rising was better than HG because it has a deeper backstory, a more developed future world, better friendships, and Darrow was cooler than Katniss. I think it would make a better movie. However, I do think Woody Harrelson should be in both movies (you’ll see which character if you read it). You should take me seriously about this because I read HG before the hype (it’s true, ok!) and I am an ardent fan of it still. To become a full-fledged Gold and a member of the “Peerless Scarred” who are the ruling members of the Gold society, you must get into the Institute (Darrow undergoes extensive training and a makeover, which I always love reading about) and be physically and mentally fit. Then you get sorted into Houses (whoa, feeling the HP? Don’t worry, it’s not the same) when Roman/Greek proctors choose you. By that, I mean the proctors are named Mars, Athena, Pluto, etc, and you’re chosen based on where you best fit. I loved this! I felt a nice little Percy Jackson vibe in there. Then, all the students live in the secluded wilderness with their housemates and have to fight to become the dominant House so that at the end of the year they can get the 
                  best internships and apprenticeships. It’s all about power and networking!</p></div>
